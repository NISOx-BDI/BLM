# Missingness Thresholding: 3 types of threshold for missingness are available;
# Relative, Absolute and Mask. 
# For Relative: enter the proportion, either as a fraction of decimal
# or percentage, of subjects required at a voxel for it to be included in the 
# analysis. E.g. if you wish to retain all voxels which are included in at
# least 10% of subject masks, enter either 0.01 or 10%.
# For Absolute: enter the number of subjects observed at a voxel for it to be
# included in the analysis. E.g. if you wish to retain all voxels which are included in at
# least 15 of subject masks, enter 15.
# For masking: Enter the filepath to the nifti mask you wish to use.
# Examples:
Missingness:
  MinPercent: 0.10
  MinN: 15
  Masking: /well/win/software/packages/fsl/5.0.11/data/standard/MNI152_T1_2mm_brain_mask.nii.gz
